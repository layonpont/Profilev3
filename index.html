                         I specialize in Angular.js as a front-end framework accompanied with the angular-material library. 
                         I am familiar working with a Node.js backend with Firebase, Mongo or PostgreSQL as the data-base. 
                         I prefer using a macbook pro, iterm2, and sublime3 text editor to start my build process.

                        I am currently looking for a remote developer role working on Angular.js projects.

                        I have worked for three creative companies working as their main front-end guy. 
                        I have experience setting up app structures from my terminal building from the ground up. 
                        At my last gig I created the front-end web version of a mobile app. 
                        The app had to authenticate users, allow them to upload large amounts of data with an excel file, and create content.

                    <p class="bottom-text">
                        I am able to communicate very well with CTO’s, Chief Designers, Dev Ops, and Full-Stack Developers. 
                        This helps me create at my best with the latest software.

                    <h1>Learning The<br> Latest Technology</h1>
                    <p>
                        I started out as a self-taught web developer taking a CS course (CS50 at edx.org). 
                        After consuming core concepts of C and how to compile it with the terminal I wanted to learn how to make visual web applications. 
                        With the help of Udemy instructors on-line I started to learn the magic of javascript. 
                        I learned how to program with php and I learned how to use bootstrap (css library) to expedite responsive design. 
                        Once I had an understanding of how to make dynamic web pages I matriculated to General Assembly’s Full Stack Immersive Program. 
                        I was taught how to build apps quickly with ruby on rails and angular.js.
                         I graduated in February 2015. Since then I have gone on to work for four successful start-ups as a Front-End Developer. 
                        The companies I have developed for in order of 2015 to 2016 are Pinwheels, Colab.la, The HQ, and TrivNow.

                        I practice what I am good at and I work tirelessly to learn the latest technology to help me become a reliable contributor to your next project.
